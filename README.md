# Image-Processing-Homeworks

## Thresholded Image Processor
### This code provides an image processing tool that allows the user to select an image, convert it to grayscale if necessary, and apply a threshold filter to isolate pixel values within a specified range. The user is prompted to enter a lower and upper threshold (between 0 and 255) for pixel values. The code then modifies the image by turning any pixels outside the specified range to black (0). The processed image is displayed and saved.
